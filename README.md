# Modeling-C

Code for the creation of two logit models on four variables (multiple features created with interactions and polynomial terms). Cross validation was used to assess the model's predictive accuracy and ensure that models were not being overfitted.

Used R for data exploration and initial model exploration (also contains statistics on chosen model coefficients)
Used Python for cross-validation and final model creation
